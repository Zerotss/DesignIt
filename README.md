# Design It!

**Design It!** is a room design application created as part of my final degree project for the *Cross-Platform Application Development* program. The aim is to provide an intuitive tool for users to design and visualize their interior spaces quickly and easily.

This project is my first venture into Unity development and has served as a valuable learning experience, allowing me to master key aspects of the Unity environment and integrate Firebase for data management.

## Features

- **Room Layout Creation**: Design room layouts by defining dimensions and adding furniture.
- **Furniture Placement**: Modify and move furniture around your custom-designed room.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple, intuitive controls for non-technical users to easily create room designs.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Unity**: Main development platform.
- **Balsamiq**: Mockups and prototypes for UI/UX design.

## Key Learning Outcomes

- Gained hands-on experience with Unity's core mechanics and features.
- Mastered Firebase integration for real-time data storage and management.
- Developed and tested a complete application, receiving user feedback to enhance usability.
